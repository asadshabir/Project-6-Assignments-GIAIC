Python OOP Mastery: 21 Assignments 🐍✨
Welcome to my Python OOP Journey! 🎉 This project is a collection of 21 assignments that dive deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. From basic classes to advanced concepts like decorators and custom iterators, I’ve tackled each challenge to build a solid foundation in Python programming. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, check out my work, try the code, and join me in mastering OOP! 🚀
About the Project 📚
This repository contains solutions to 21 assignments focused on OOP concepts in Python. Each assignment builds on the previous one, starting with simple classes and progressing to complex topics like multiple inheritance, decorators, and custom exceptions. I’ve coded, tested, and reviewed each solution to ensure they’re clear, functional, and fun to explore! 😎
Why This Project? 🤔

Learn OOP: Understand key concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.
Hands-On Coding: Each assignment includes practical code you can run and tweak.
Real-World Skills: From custom exceptions to iterators, these skills are used in real Python projects.
Teaching Others: I’m using this to teach my friends OOP, so the code is beginner-friendly! 🙌

Assignment Highlights 🌟
Here’s a quick overview of the 21 assignments I’ve conquered:

Employee Class 📝: Built a class with public/private attributes and methods.
Teacher Inheritance 👩‍🏫: Extended a Person class with inheritance.
Shape Abstract Class 📐: Used abstract methods for shapes like Circle.
(Assignments 4–6): Explored more class basics and methods (details in code).
(Assignments 7–11): Deepened OOP with encapsulation and polymorphism.
Temperature Converter 🌡️: Created a class with static methods.
Car & Engine Composition 🚗: Modeled a “has-a” relationship.
Department & Employee Aggregation 🏢: Implemented a looser “has-a” relationship.
Multiple Inheritance & MRO 🔗: Mastered method resolution order.
Function Decorators 🎁: Added behavior to functions with @log_function_call.
Class Decorators 🏷️: Modified classes to add methods dynamically.
(Assignment 18): Bridged concepts with more OOP practice.
Callable Objects 🛠️: Made a Multiplier class callable with __call__().
Custom Exceptions 🚨: Created InvalidAgeError for error handling.
Custom Iterators ⏲️: Built a Countdown class iterable in for loops.

How to Use This Repo 🖥️

Clone the Repo:git clone <https://github.com/asadshabir/Project-6-Assignments-GIAIC>


Run the Code:
Each assignment is in a separate .py file (e.g., assignment_01.py).
Use Python 3: python assignment_01.py


Explore & Tweak:
Check the comments in each file for explanations.
Try modifying the code (e.g., change the countdown start in Assignment_21).


Learn & Teach:
Use this as a guide to learn OOP or teach others, like I’m doing with my friends! 😄



What I Learned 🧠

Core OOP: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Advanced Features: Decorators, special methods (__call__, __iter__, __next__), and custom exceptions.
Problem-Solving: Tackled real-world scenarios like age validation and countdown timers.
Teaching Skills: Prepared to explain OOP to my friends with clear examples and analogies.

Future Plans 🔮

Review & Retry: I’m revisiting all 21 assignments to code them from scratch and deepen my understanding.
Expand: Add more advanced topics like metaclasses or design patterns.
Teach: Use this repo in my OOP class to help my friends master Python! 📚
